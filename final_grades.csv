Question 1: What is Machine Learning? Explain the main types of machine learning with,85,"The answer provides a clear and accurate definition of Machine Learning along with the main types. The examples given for Supervised Learning are appropriate, though more detail could be added to Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning sections."
Question 2: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff and demonstrate it with code.,85,"The explanation of the bias-variance tradeoff is clear and accurate. The code provided effectively demonstrates underfitting (high bias), balanced fitting, and overfitting (high variance) using polynomial degrees as a proxy for model complexity. However, the answer could be improved by including error metrics or visualizations to illustrate the differences in performance."
Question 3: What is overfitting and how can it be prevented? Provide code examples.,85,"The student provides a correct definition of overfitting and lists several prevention techniques. However, the code examples are incomplete and contain errors (e.g., missing import for LinearRegression). The early stopping example is not provided in code. (Human Verified)"
Question 4: Describe precision and recall with a code implementation.,85,N/A (Human Verified)
Question 5: Explain gradient descent and implement it from scratch.,85,"The student provides a clear explanation of gradient descent and implements it correctly for linear regression. However, the initial part of the answer includes irrelevant code that calculates metrics unrelated to gradient descent implementation."
Question 6: Explain neural networks and build a simple one using code.,85,"The student provides a clear explanation of neural networks and implements both a simple one from scratch and uses an existing library. The code is mostly correct, but the training loop for the custom implementation is missing."
